    <p>Welcome to #SexInIndia channel at DALnet. This channel is being run by an Indian for Indians 
    who are open to chat with an open mind about everything related to sexuality. Although everything
    goes on this channel we do not allow Pedophilia and Child Pornography. Anyone found chatting about
    the above mentioned topics will be banned from the channel, probably for good. You are also expected 
    to be a legal adult according to the law of your country. However, I do not see any problem if a
    minor is interested in sex education and discussion.  User seventhmusketeer is the founder of 
    this channel. If you want to reach him please send an email at <a href="mailto:seventhmusketeer@riseup.net">seventhmusketeer@riseup.net</a>.
    Pic sharing is allowed in the channel but only keep it to your private messages, please do not post the links
    on the main channel feed. Be respectful, just because somebody is talking about sex doesn't mean that he or she
    is a character less person. Sexuality is an integral part of our lives and we should be free to talk about it
    both for our learning as well as our pleasure. It is allowed to use cheap words if that brings flavour to your
    conversation. </p>

    <p>Note: This channel does not take the responsiblity of the Genuinity of the people chatting here. Please be cautious about sharing
    your personal details. If you ever plan to meet in person with someone you have found here the consequence of your
    meeting will be your sole responsibility. We will not be held responsible if you get robbed or abused sexually or otherwise.</p>

    <p>This channel also has a flickr account with the pics created or collected by the founder to showcase an expression of 
    artistic sexuality (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/167648327@N06/albums">https://www.flickr.com/photos/167648327@N06/albums</a>). 
    You will have to signup to flickr to view them as they are Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content. 
    If you wish your pictures to be included here then please send them to the above mentioned email id.</p>

    <p>We are also planning to include sex stories on this website therefore, if you want to contribute
    either a fictional story or a personal anecdote then please send them to the above mentioned email.</p>
