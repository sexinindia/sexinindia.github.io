    <p>Welcome to #SexInIndia channel at DALnet. This channel is being run by Indians for Indians 
    who are open to chat with an open mind about everything related to sexuality. Although everything
    goes on this channel, we do not allow Pedophilia and Child Pornography. Anyone found talking about
    the topics mentioned above will be banned from the channel, probably for good. You are also expected 
    to be a legal adult according to the law of your country. However, we do not see any problem if a
    minor is interested in sex education and discussion.  User seventhmusketeer is the founder of 
    this channel. If you want to reach them, please send an email to <b><a href="mailto:seventhmusketeer@riseup.net">seventhmusketeer@riseup.net</a></b>.
    Pic sharing is allowed in the channel but only keep it to your private messages; please do not post the links
    on the main channel feed. Be respectful, just because somebody is talking about sex doesn't mean that he or she
    is a characterless person. Sexuality is an integral part of our lives, and we should be free to talk about it
    both for our learning as well as our pleasure. It is allowed to use cheap words if that brings flavour to your
    conversation. </p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> This channel does not take responsibility for the authenticity of the people chatting here. Please be cautious about sharing
    your details. If you ever plan to meet someone in person whom you have found here, then the consequence of your
    meeting will be your sole responsibility. We will not take responsibility if you get robbed or abused sexually or otherwise.</p>

    <p>This channel also has a <b><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/167648327@N06/albums">Flickr</a></b> account with the pics 
    created or collected by the founder to showcase an expression of artistic sexuality. 
    You will have to signup to Flickr to view them as they are Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content. 
    If you wish to include your pictures in this collection, then please send them to the email address mentioned above.</p>

    <p>We are also planning to include sex stories on this website, therefore, if you want to contribute
    either a fictional story or a personal anecdote, then please send them to the email address mentioned above.</p>
